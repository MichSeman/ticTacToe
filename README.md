# ticTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game assignment for MIT 
### future improvements:
I would like to add a timer indicating to players how much time they have to make a move in the game before it switches to the other players turn. I will do this by adding a counter feature and a preview of the counter. 

Improving the style of the game is something I plan on doing. I may use bootstrap and google fonts to style the App.
